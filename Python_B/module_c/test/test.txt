An absolute path contains the entire path to the file or directory that we need to access. It includes the complete directory list required to locate the file.

For example, E:\PYnative\files_demos\read_demo.txt is an absolute path to discover the read_demo.txt. All of the information needed to find the file is contained in the path string.

While opening a file for reading its contents we have always ensured that we are providing the correct path. In case the file not present in the provided path we will get FileNotFoundError.

We can avoid this by wrapping the file opening code in the try-except-finally block.hello
